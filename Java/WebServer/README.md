# WEB SERVERS WITH JAVA
Think of 2 cellphones communicating with each other. One is the web server and the another one is the web browser.
- Web browser send a message (request) to the web server. HTTP.
- Web server send a message (response) to the web browser.

## REQUEST
- GET (can you get me the message/file?)

## RESPONSE
- HTTP/1.1 200 OK(HTTP STATUS CODES: 404 - NOT FOUND)

## What is a web server in fact?
- Anything that you acess on the internet (web browser) is running by a web server. So you need connect this 2 things.
